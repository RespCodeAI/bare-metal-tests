# bare-metal-tests

Public test results from [RespCode](https://respcode.com) — AI-generated bare-metal firmware compiled, validated, and verified on real hardware.

This repository contains the complete, unmodified source code and compiled binaries from RespCode's multi-model compete mode tests. Every file was generated by an AI model, compiled with real ARM cross-compilers, validated against CMSIS-SVD peripheral databases, and where possible, flashed to physical development boards. Nothing was hand-edited.

All tests are reproducible on [respcode.com](https://respcode.com) using Compete Mode with the same prompts documented in each test folder.

## What is RespCode?

[RespCode](https://respcode.com) is a multi-model AI code generation platform that orchestrates multiple AI models across different architectures — x86, ARM64, RISC-V, FPGA, and bare-metal ARM. For embedded targets, RespCode doesn't just generate code — it compiles with real toolchains, validates register addresses against official SVD hardware databases, and produces downloadable firmware binaries ready to flash.

**Key capabilities:**

- **11 AI models** — Claude Opus 4.6, Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-5.2, GPT-5, GPT-4.1, o4-mini, Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek Coder, DeepSeek Reasoner, Llama 4 Scout
- **Compete Mode** — Run the same prompt across multiple models simultaneously, compare outputs side by side
- **2,701 MCUs supported** — ARM Cortex-M0/M0+/M3/M4/M7/M23/M33 targets from STM32, NXP LPC/i.MX, Nordic nRF, Microchip SAM, and more
- **SVD register validation** — Auto-corrects wrong peripheral base addresses using 2,177 CMSIS-SVD files (2,690 MCUs covered)
- **Downloadable artifacts** — `.bin`, `.hex`, and `.elf` firmware files ready for flashing

## Tests

| Test | Target Board | Models | Winner | Date |
|:-----|:-------------|:-------|:-------|:-----|
| [LPC55S69 LED Blink](./lpc55s69_led_blink_tests/) | NXP LPC55S69-EVK | Opus 4.6, GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, DeepSeek Coder | **Gemini 3 Pro** ✅ | Feb 2026 |

Each test folder contains the full source code, compiled binaries, per-model analysis, and the exact prompt used. See the README inside each folder for detailed results.

## How to Read These Tests

Every test folder follows the same structure:

```
test-name/
├── model-name/
│   ├── source/          # AI-generated source files (unmodified, post-SVD-fix)
│   │   ├── main.c
│   │   ├── startup.c
│   │   ├── <device>.h
│   │   └── linker.ld
│   └── binary/
│       └── firmware.bin # Compiled binary, ready to flash
├── ...                  # One folder per model tested
└── README.md            # Results, analysis, and the exact prompt
```

**Source files are post-SVD-correction** — they reflect what was actually compiled. Each test README documents what the SVD validator changed.

**Binaries are real** — compiled with `arm-none-eabi-gcc` inside RespCode's Docker-based sandbox. You can flash them to the target board or disassemble them yourself.
